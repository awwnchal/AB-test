# AB-test
 We will discuss different topics of A/B testing -- how to choose the metrics, design the experiments and analyze the results after running the experiments. We also cover some statistical background required for A/B testing. We build an interactive ecommerce example to learn how to analyze results from A/B testing.
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product after a free trial. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. We will use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report conclusions and recommendations in a report.
 
 The project included choosing a metric, building intuition, defining hypothesis and comparing two samples for hypothesis testing.
